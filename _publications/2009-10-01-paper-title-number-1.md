title: "Space-Time Graph Neural Networks"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'Space-time graph neural network are tailored to jointly process the underlying space-time topology of time-varying network data. In this paper, we introduce a general notion of convolutions that led to introducing this new vartiation of GNNs and prove its stability to domain deformations.'
