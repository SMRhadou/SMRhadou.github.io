title: "Space-Time Graph Neural Networks"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'Space-time graph neural networks are tailored to learn representations from time-varying graph data that are defined over a joint space-time domain. In this paper, we introduce a new notion of convolutions that led to introducing this new vartiation of GNNs and prove its stability to domain deformations.'
