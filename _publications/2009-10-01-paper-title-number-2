title: "Space-time graph neural networks with stochastic graph perturbations"
collection: publications
authors: <b>Samar Hadou</b>, Charilaos Kanatsoulis, and Alejandro Ribeiro.
excerpt: 'Space-time graph neural networks are tailored to learn representations from time-varying graph data. In this paper, we introduce a new notion of convolutions that led to introducing this new vartiation of GNNs and prove its stability to domain deformations.'
