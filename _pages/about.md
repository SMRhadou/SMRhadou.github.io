Hello! 

I am Samar (pronounced as Summer or /ˈsʌmə(ɹ)/), a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/">Alejandro Ribeiro</a>. I spend my time at Penn exploring how to make neural networks more efficient, reliable, and generalizable for solving optimization problems, going beyond imitation learning. A central theme of my work is descent neural networks, which are  models whose layers emulate optimization dynamics. I study these networks in settings spanning unconstrained, distributed, constrained, and stochastic optimization. I am also interested in graph learning and currently investigating generative modeling for graph-structured signals. My ongoing research aims to extend these threads to optimization-driven generative models, with the goal of developing principled learning systems for decision making under constraints. Prior to joining Penn, I was a lecturer assistant at Port Said University, Egypt, from which I had received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering.

I am on the academic job market.
