Hello! 

I am Samar (pronounced /ˈsʌmə(ɹ)/ or summer), a first-year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/">Alejandro Ribeiro</a>. My research interests span machine learning, signal processing, optimization and GNNs. Prior to that, I was a research assistant at Port Said University, where I also received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees and still hold a tenure-track position. 

I am obssesed with the human intelligence and willing to replicate it on machines. I also love developing theories since it makes me look like a scientist. As an engineer, I definitely tend to employ these theories to solve problems in different areas. So I would like to collaborate with others from different disciplines that are of interest to me, but currently I am buried under tons of coursework! So in the near future, you (Yes, you!) might be my next collaborator. In my spare time, I play giant Jigsaw puzzles and pretend to be a beginner chess player.
