Hello! 

I am Samar (pronounced /ˈsʌmə(ɹ)/ or summer), a second-year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/">Alejandro Ribeiro</a>. My research interests focus on the theories of machine learning and signal processing. I try to answer the Whys and Hows to provide a better understanding of the known as well as to explore the unknowns.

I am obssesed with the human intelligence and willing to replicate it on machines. I love to develop theories, which, hopefully, can facilitate handling real-world problems. I am currenty working on the the theories behind graph neural networks (GNNs). More about my work would come later.

Do you want to talk to me? Send me email on selaraby (at) seas.upenn.edu. I would be glad to hear from you.

Thank you!
