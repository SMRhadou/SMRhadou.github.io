Hello! 

I am Samar (pronounced as Summer or /ˈsʌmə(ɹ)/), a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/">Alejandro Ribeiro</a>. My research interests focus on graph learning, generative modeling and optimization.

Reach out at selaraby (at) seas (dot) upenn (dot) edu.
