Hello! 

I am Samar (I can hear you saying Sam-AH-r. Nope! It is /ˈsʌmə(ɹ)/ = summer), a second-year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/">Alejandro Ribeiro</a>. My research interests focus on the theories of machine learning and signal processing. I try to answer the Whys and Hows to better understand the known and explore the unknowns. This is a fancy way to say I do not know exactly what I am doing :) Unlike how this might sound, it is a great place to be in. It means that there is always a problem that gets my interest so I chase it till I learn something new. 

This is supposed to be my official, professional webpage, which would land me in a fancy job one day. Does not look like one to you? I cannot blame you.

P.S. I am looking for online reading groups in theoretical machine learning. If you had any suggestions for me, I would be so grateful to hear from you.
