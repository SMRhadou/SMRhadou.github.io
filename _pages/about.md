Hello! 

I am Samar (pronounced as Summer or /ˈsʌmə(ɹ)/), a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/">Alejandro Ribeiro</a>. I spend my time at Penn exploring how to make neural networks more efficient and generalizable in solving optimization problems beyond the scope of imitation learning. My research journey has included work on algorithm unrolling with descent constraints, applied to diverse settings such as constrained optimization, bilevel optimization and federated learning. I am also interested in graph learning and currently investigating generative modeling for graph-structured signals. My ongoing research aims to extend these ideas to optimization-driven generative models. Prior to joining Penn, I was a lecturer assistant at Port Said University, Egypt, from which I had received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering.
