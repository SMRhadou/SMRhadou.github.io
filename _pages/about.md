Hello! 

I am Samar (pronounced /ˈsʌmə(ɹ)/ or summer), a second-year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/">Alejandro Ribeiro</a>. My research interests focus on theories of machine learning and signal processing.
