Hello! 

I am Samar (pronounced /ˈsʌmə(ɹ)/ or summer), a first-year PhD student at the <b> University of Pennsylvania</b>, where I work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/">Alejandro Ribeiro</a>. My research interests span machine learning, signal processing, optimization and GNNs. Prior to that, I was a research assistant at Port Said University, where I received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees, and still hold a tenure track position.
