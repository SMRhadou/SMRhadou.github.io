Hello! 

I am Samar (pronounced /ˈsʌmə(ɹ)/ or summer), a second-year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I work under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/alejandro-ribeiro/">Alejandro Ribeiro</a>. My research interests focus on the theories of machine learning and signal processing. I try to answer the Whys and Hows to better understand the known and explore the unknowns.

Do you want to talk to me? Send me an email on selaraby (at) seas.upenn.edu. I would be glad to hear from you.
